## HTML Pages
In both the before and after folders, there are 2 HTML pages. One changes a dark mode bar chart to a light mode bar chart, and the other changes a light mode bar chart to a dark mode bar chart.

## Before Folder
In the before folder, there is a file called works.html and one called not-working.html. In works.html, a light mode bar chart successfully gets changed to a dark mode bar chart. In the not-working.html file, a dark mode bar chart fails to change to a light mode bar chart.

## After Folder
The after folder contains the changed apexcharts.js bundle with the changes in it that fixed the issue with changing the dark mode bar chart to a light mode one.
